This repo Consists of the projects that I did while learning basic opencv
1. Motion Detection: The program first subtracts the second frame from the first then stores the absolute values then Canny Edge detection is used to find the edges in the frames. Then using findContours() function countours are found out. If no contours are found then movement is not detected else movement is detected. The contours are then plotted over the frame and and then the process is repeated.
